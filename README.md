About branches:
Use a branch to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository. Each repository has one default branch, and can have multiple other branches. You can merge a branch into another branch using a pull request.
https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-branches#about-the-default-branch

Creating a pull request:
Create a pull request to propose and collaborate on changes to a repository. These changes are proposed in a branch, which ensures that the default branch only contains finished and approved work.
https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request

About pull requests:
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.
https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests

Linking a pull request to an issue:
You can link a pull request to an issue to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when the pull request is merged.
https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue

Product--GitHub Actions:
Automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository with GitHub Actions. You can discover, create, and share actions to perform any job you'd like, including CI/CD, and combine actions in a completely customized workflow.
https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions

Understanding the GitHub flow:
GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects where deployments are made regularly. This guide explains how and why GitHub flow works.

About continuous integration:
You can create custom continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) workflows directly in your GitHub repository with GitHub Actions.
